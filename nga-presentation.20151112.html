# Introduction

---
layout: false

## Introduction

.image[![Modern application architecture](images/applications-architecture.png)]

* Existing libraries: MVC, Flux, React
* in Firefox OS, we stay as close as possible to the metal

---

## Single-page apps

Firefox OS applications are normal Single-page apps:

* Using a unique URL
* Hiding/showing views, possibly changing the URL hash
* In-memory model

--

... And it worked quite well so far, performance close or better to Android on
the same device.

---

## Issues with the current approach

The NG Architecture is designed to help us overcome current issues, especially:
* packaged applications,
???
Zip archive so that we can sign to get more privileges.
--

* updates,
???
* certified applications
* updates of part of the app
--

* launching speed, perceived performance and latency,
???
difficult to get the first rendering quickly, need to control the resource
loading
--

* animations janks,
???
We need to have everything running on the GPU. Even with this it's just too easy
to load the UI thread and miss a frame in an animation, and it turns out our
brain is very sensitive to this.
--

* memory management,
???
In a Single-page app model we keep all the data for all the views in memory.
It's extremely difficult to free up the memory once it's allocated. And it's
extremely easy to keep a hard reference preventing the GC from running.
--

* leverage multi-core processors,
???
JS is inherently single-thread. It's difficult to leverage several cores. Yet
it's especially important on mobile where we usually have several not-that-fast
cores.
--

* adapting interface to different form factors.
???
Firefox OS works on low-end devices and 4K high-end TVs. Today it's difficult to
adapt the interface to these different devices. + Theming

---

## Our tools

Tools we have to fix this:
* Workers and shared workers,
???
Not so easy to use, a lot of APIs are missing. But it's a fondamental tool to
escape from the single-thread model of JS.
--

* Service Worker,
???
Complex and rich subject, let's not enter into details.

* Middle-man
* Cache
* clear lifecycle

--

* IFrames,
???
IFrames could be either managed by a Content Wrapper or directly by the System
app.

Completely encapsulate a DOM: split reflows, split memory.
--

* Channel communication:
[BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API)
and [Channel Messaging API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API).
???
BroadcastChannel allows a communication between documents even without sharing a
common reference.

MessageChannel allows a p2p communication.

# Roadmap

---

## Roadmap

* Split views in separate documents.
* Move the model and most business logic to shared workers.
* Provide offline capability with service workers.
* Investigate various cache levels in service workers.
* Investigate how updates can work with hosted apps.
* Keep master in working condition.

---

# Views and navigation

---

## Views and navigation
### The SMS application before NGA

* A panel-oriented application.
* Each panel has its own JavaScript behavior object.
* All navigation is handled in one object in JavaScript.
* Lifecycle-oriented methods.
* CSS transitions and transformations are used to slide panels.
* The URL does not change as the user navigates (although this could be done
with the current architecture).
* No lazy list.
* Works in Firefox using mocks.

---

## Views and navigation
### The SMS application before NGA: issues

* When the app has a lot of data, reflows are long.
* Some cross-view dependencies, involving sometimes complex objects.
* Some model is in the DOM.
* Models, Views and Controllers are quite interweaved together.
* CSS is not really well architectured.
* No direct access to one view (eg: we first display Inbox and only then the
requested view).
* Need to access several data sources at startup: messages, drafts, contacts,
facebook contacts, settings.

---

## Views and navigation
### Split views: a recipe ?

1. Systematically review your CSS and decide in which view rules belong. Then
move these rules in separate files in separate directories.
2. Decide which javascript files belong to which view. Move these rules in
separate directories.
3. Kill all direct cross-view dependencies: use events.
4. Create separate documents in these directories: first goal is to make them
load properly in Firefox. We keep the main index.html file for users.
5. Both the separate documents and the main index.html use the same JS and CSS
files (except the bootstrap script).

--

Moreover we rely a lot on integration tests to keep master in good shape.

---

## Views and navigation
### Split views: current status and issues ([Bug 1155507](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1155507))

* Only 2 views are split, remaining ones are still in one of them.
* [Bug 818000](http://bugzil.la/818000) prevents switching to split views for
now: we don't receive system messages if the right endpoint is not loaded.

???
"Only 2 views are split, remaining ones are still in one of them": this allows
moving in an iteratively way and still use all the NGA libraries.

system messages: Or have view-in-iframe where top level document can handle system messages for
us and navigation happens inside iframe.

--

Alternatively we can
decide to ignore system messages.
--
 ;-)

---

## Views and navigation
### Navigation

* A navigation that works both with new style (separate
documents) and old style (several views in one document) to make it possible to
evolve iteratively.
* A navigation that supports the basic panel lifecycle.

This still looks ugly until we get Navigation Transition and prerendering though.

# Services

---
class: dense

## Services
### Initial phase

Having a service layer is a good opportunity to think about basic methods.

We looked at every action of every view and decided:
* which data we needed,
* which action we need to perform.

--

Then for each set of data and each action we had an operation that we organized
by common responsibility:

* Conversation: returns everything related to messages and conversations,
including all related data (eg: contact information).
* Contacts: makes it possible to search among conctacts.
* Messaging: network-related operations.
* ...

For more information, [go and read the
README](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/sms/services/README.md).

---
## Services
### Implementation ([meta bug 1162031](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1162031))

Because the bridge library uses plain strings to call service methods, we wrap
this in higher-level clients.

We also start by creating the pure interface and only then implement the content
as we need it, by functionality.

First functionality we want to implement is loading the initial inbox.

We want to be able to use the service in both split and non-split modes.

---
## Services
### Use of shims to proxy mozAPI

The SMS application uses several mozAPIs that are not available in workers:
* mozMobileMessaging,
* mozContacts,
* mozActivity...

Special services will live in a window context (an hidden iframe) to proxy these
calls.

---
## Services
### What about the performance ?

With all these cross-worker calls we will add up much latency.

We want to reduce this latency through two ways:
* store all the pre-digested data in a indexedDB that will be accessed by the
first accessed worker.
* leverage the service worker to cache the rendered views.

Moreover [postMessage during document load is slow](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164539).

---
## Service Workers

.center[![Service worker caches](images/Gaia_Architecture_Proposal_Service_Worker_Overview.png)]

* The offline cache keeps the remote files locally.
* The custom cache allows to change some view or behavior at runtime.
* The render cache is able to cache the generated HTML.

---

# What's next ?

## What's next ?

* Implement the services.
* Implement the Service Worker part (including render cache).
* Implement the Integrated DB.
* Improve the performance.
* Polish everything.
