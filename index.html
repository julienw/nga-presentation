# Introduction

---
layout: false

## Introduction

The NG Architecture is designed to help us overcome current issues, especially:
* perceived performance and latency,
* updates,
* packaged applications,
* launching speed,
* animations janks,
* memory management,
* leverage multi-core processors.

---

## Introduction

Tools we have to fix this:
* Workers and shared workers,
* Service Worker,
* IFrames,
* Channel communication:
[BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API)
and [Channel Messaging API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API).

# Goals

---

## Goals

* Split views in separate documents.
* Move the model and most business logic to shared workers.
* Provide offline capability with service workers.
* Investigate various cache levels in service workers.
* Investigate how updates can work with hosted apps.
* Keep master in working condition.

---

# Landing code

---

## Landing code

Different options:
* Landing code in master;
* Landing code in a separate branch in the Gaia directory (one branch per app);
* Landing code in a separate branch in the Gaia directory (one branch for all nga);
* Landing code in a separate repository.

--

We chose to land on master. We can accept performance regression but no
functional regression.

We also have basically 2 versions coexisting on master. See the [github repository](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/apps/sms).

# Views and navigation

---

## Views and navigation
### The SMS application before NGA

* A panel-oriented application.
* Each panel has its own JavaScript behavior object.
* All navigation is handled in one object in JavaScript.
* Lifecycle-oriented methods.
* CSS transitions and transformations are used to slide panels.
* The URL does not change as the user navigates (although this could be done
with the current architecture).
* No lazy list.
* Works in Firefox using mocks.

---

## Views and navigation
### The SMS application before NGA: issues

* When the app has a lot of data, reflows are long.
* Some cross-view dependencies, involving sometimes complex objects.
* Some model is in the DOM.
* Models, Views and Controllers are quite interweaved together.
* CSS is not really well architectured.
* No direct access to one view (eg: we first display Inbox and only then the
requested view).
* Need to access several data sources at startup: messages, drafts, contacts,
facebook contacts, settings.

---

## Views and navigation
### Split views: a recipe ?

1. Systematically review your CSS and decide in which view rules belong. Then
move these rules in separate files in separate directories.
2. Decide which javascript files belong to which view. Move these rules in
separate directories.
3. Kill all direct cross-view dependencies: use events.
4. Create separate documents in these directories: first goal is to make them
load properly in Firefox. We keep the main index.html file for users.
5. Both the separate documents and the main index.html use the same JS and CSS
files (except the bootstrap script).

--

Moreover we rely a lot on integration tests to keep master in good shape.

---

## Views and navigation
### Split views: current status and issues ([Bug 1155507](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1155507))

* Only 2 views are split, remaining ones are still in one of them.
* [Bug 818000](http://bugzil.la/818000) prevents switching to split views for
now: we don't receive system messages if the right endpoint is not loaded.
~~
"Only 2 views are split, remaining ones are still in one of them": this allows
moving in an iteratively way and still use all the NGA libraries.

???
Or have view-in-iframe where top level document can handle system messages for
us and navigation happens inside iframe.

--

Alternatively we can
decide to ignore system messages.
--
 ;-)

---

## Views and navigation
### Navigation

* A navigation that works both with new style (separate
documents) and old style (several views in one document) to make it possible to
evolve iteratively.
* A navigation that supports the basic panel lifecycle.
* still in progress ([Bug 1162030](http://bugzil.la/1162030)).

This still looks ugly until we get Navigation Transition though (more on that
during Vivien's presentation!).

Demo of the current branch with Navigation.

# Services

---
class: dense

## Services
### Initial phase

Having a service layer is a good opportunity to think about basic methods.

We looked at every action of every view and decided:
* which data we needed,
* which action we need to perform.

--

Then for each set of data and each action we had an operation that we organized
by common responsibility:

* Conversation: returns everything related to messages and conversations,
including all related data (eg: contact information).
* Contacts: makes it possible to search among conctacts.
* Messaging: network-related operations.
* ...

For more information, [go and read the
README](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/sms/services/README.md).

---
## Services
### Implementation ([meta bug 1162031](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1162031))

Because the threads library uses plain string to call service methods, we wrap
this in higher-level clients.

We also start by creating the pure interface and only then implement the content
as we need it, by functionality.

First functionality we want to implement is loading the initial inbox.

We want to be able to use the service in both split and non-split modes.

---
## Services
### Use of shims to proxy mozAPI

The SMS application uses several mozAPIs that are not available in workers:
* mozMobileMessaging,
* mozContacts,
* mozActivity...

Special services will live in a window context (an hidden iframe) to proxy these
calls.

---
## Services
### What about the performance ?

With all these cross-worker calls we will add up much latency.

We want to reduce this latency through two ways:
* store all the pre-digested data in a indexedDB that will be accessed by the
first accessed worker.
* leverage the service worker to cache the rendered views.
* [postMessage during document load is slow](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164539).

# Service Worker

---

## Service Worker .smaller[([Bug 1172902](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1172902))]

Not much has been done yet. Mainly some testing which was already useful to find
bugs.

We're still debugging bugs with Service Workers working with the app://
protocol.

See https://ng-messages.github.io/views/inbox for a WIP working in Nightly
(with DEBUG=1 profile) and latest Spark build.

# What's next ?

---

## What's next ?

* Implement the services.
* Implement the Service Worker part (including render cache).
* Implement the Integrated DB.
* Implement the navigation.
* Improve the performance.
* Polish everything.
